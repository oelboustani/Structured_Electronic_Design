# Assignment 2 - Design Study
## Instruction
The main design example and also exercise of this course it the active antenna. In the [topic 1.4](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=290724&type=content&rcode=tudelft-684675) “Application description of the active antenna”, that was discussed in lecture 1, you can find all specifications for this design.

In this assignment-2 we want you to do a selection of small design studies of the active antenna where you evaluate a way to implement the active antenna with a single stage or a cascade of two stages.

The study of an overall negative feedback topology is not part of this assignment-2! This will be discussed later during this course.

Each task gives, based on its complexity, a certain workload (#pts). You should select enough studies to achieve a total at least 100pts. You can use both LT-Spice and SLiCAP for the study.

Study the design of an active antenna implemented as:

Study the design of an active antenna implemented as:

- A CS stage (20pts)
- A balanced CS stage (40pts)
- An unbalanced single-loop feedback stage (40pts)
- A balanced single-loop feedback stage (50pts)
- A balanced or unbalanced dual-loop feedback stage (60pts)
- Two cascaded CS stages (50pts)
- Two cascaded stages (unequal types) (80pts)
